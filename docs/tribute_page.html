      <h2 class="article__heading">Who was Jerry Tomas?</h2>
      <p><strong>Jeremiah "Jerry" P. Thomas (October 30, 1830 – December 15, 1885)</strong> was an American bartender
        who owned and operated saloons in New York City. Because of his pioneering work in popularizing cocktails across
        the United States as well, he is considered "the father of American mixology". In addition to writing the
        seminal work on cocktails, <span>"The Bar-Tender's Guide"</span> (alternately titled <span>"How to Mix Drinks or
          The Bon-Vivant's Companion"</span>), Thomas displayed creativity and showmanship while preparing drinks and
        established the image of the bartender as a creative professional. As such, he was often nicknamed <span>the
          "Professor" Jerry Thomas.</span></p>

      <h3>Early life, education and work</h3>
      <p>Thomas was born about 1830 in Sackets Harbor, New York. As a young man, he learned bartending in New Haven,
        Connecticut before sailing for California during its mid-19th century Gold Rush. While in California, Thomas
        worked as a <span>bartender, gold prospector and minstrel show manager</span>. According to his 1885 obituary,
        he was left some money by his father, which helped in these travels.</p>

      <p>Thomas moved back to the East Coast in <span>1851</span>, settling in <span>New York City</span>. He opened a
        saloon below <span>Barnum's American Museum;</span> it would be the first of four saloons he would run in New
        York City over his lifetime. After running this first bar, Thomas went on the road for several years, working as
        the head bartender at hotels and saloons in St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California;
        Charleston, South Carolina; and New Orleans, Louisiana. At one point he toured Europe, carrying along a set of
        solid-silver bar tools. He was well known for his showmanship as a bartender: he developed elaborate and flashy
        techniques of mixing cocktails, sometimes while juggling bottles, cups and mixers. He often wore flashy jewelry
        and had his bar tools and cups embellished with precious stones and metals. At the Occidental Hotel in San
        Francisco, Thomas was earning $100 a week—more than the Vice President of the United States.</p>

      <h3>The first "Bar-Tender's Guide"</h3>
      <p>In 1862, Thomas finished "Bar-Tender's Guide" (alternately titled <span>"How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant's
          Companion")</span>, the first drink book ever published in the United States. The book collected and codified
        what was then an oral tradition of recipes from the early days of cocktails, including some of his own
        creations; the guide laid down the principles for formulating mixed drinks of all categories. He would update it
        several times in his lifetime to include new drinks that he discovered or created. The first edition of the
        guide included the first written recipes of such cocktails as the <span>Brandy Daisy, Fizz, Flip, Sour</span>
        and variations of the earliest form of mixed drink, Punch. The 1876 edition included the first written recipe
        for the <span>Tom Collins</span>, which appeared just after The Tom Collins Hoax of 1874.</p>

      <h3>The flashy "Blue Blazer Cocktail"</h3>
      <p>Thomas developed his signature drink, the <span>Blue Blazer</span>, at the El Dorado gambling saloon in San
        Francisco. The drink is made by lighting whiskey afire and passing it back and forth between two mixing glasses,
        creating an arc of flame. Thomas continued to develop new drinks throughout his life. His mixing of the
        <span>"Martinez"</span>, which recipe was published in the 1887 edition of his guide, has sometimes been viewed
        as a precursor to the modern martini. Thomas claimed to have invented the Tom and Jerry and did much to
        popularize it in the United States; however, the history of the drink predated him.</p>

      <h3>From San Francisco to New York</h3>
      <p>Upon returning to New York City, he became head bartender at the Metropolitan hotel. In 1866 he opened his own
        bar again, on Broadway between 21st and 22nd Streets, which became his most famous establishment. Thomas was one
        of the first to display the drawings of Thomas Nast. In his saloon he hung Nast's caricatures of the political
        and theatrical figures; one notable drawing, now lost, was of Thomas "in nine tippling postures colossally." The
        saloon included funhouse mirrors. This historic bar has been adapted for use as a Restoration Hardware store.
      </p>
      <p>Thomas was an active man about town, a flashy dresser who was fond of kid gloves and his gold Parisian watch.
        He enjoyed going to bare-knuckle prize fights, and was an art collector. He enjoyed traveling. By middle age he
        was married and had two daughters. Always a good sport, at 205 pounds he was one of the lighter members of the
        Fat Men's Association. He had a side interest in gourds; at one point in the late 1870s, Thomas served as
        president of The Gourd Club after producing the largest specimen.</p>

      <h3>Later years, complete povery and death</h3>
      <p>Toward the end of his life, Thomas tried speculating on Wall Street, but bad judgments rendered him broke. He
        had to sell his successful saloon and auction off his considerable art collection; he tried opening a new bar
        but was unable to maintain the level of popularity as his more famous location. <span>He died in New York City
          of a stroke (apoplexy) in 1885 at the age of 55.</span> His death was marked by substantial obituaries across
        the United States. The New York Times obituary noted that Thomas was "at one time better known to club men and
        men about town than any other bartender in this city, and he was very popular among all classes." He is interred
        in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.</p>
